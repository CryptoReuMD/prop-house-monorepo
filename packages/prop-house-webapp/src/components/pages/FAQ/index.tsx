    title: 'How are proposal scores calculated?',
    content: (
      <>
        Weighted voting is used to calculate scores. 50% of voting power is held
        by Noun owners while the other 50% is held by Nouns extension
        communities. Each vote for each category has a score depending on three
        factors:
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <ul>
          <li>Total votes for both categories</li>
          <li>Voting power for specific category</li>
          <li>Total votes for specific categories</li>
        </ul>
        To get the score for individual votes, we follow the followiing formula:
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <b>
          Total votes for both categories * Voting power for specific category /
          Total votes for specific category
        </b>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Once you've gotten the individual vote score, we add up all votes for
        each proposal by assigning the individual vote score using their
        corresponding weight.
